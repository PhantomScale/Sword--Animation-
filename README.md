# Minecraft sword drawning animation (11/10 name)
I used a Python along with Turtle to make this minecraft sword thing. It took me quite a while to make but wasn't very difficult. Just a lot of copy and pasting for the most part. Turtle is a really nice add-on that you can use to make all sorts of neat images like this. I plan on making many more of these neat little things so be on the lookout for that!
